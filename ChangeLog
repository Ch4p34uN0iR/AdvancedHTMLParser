* 6.2.1 Aug 10 2015
- Add a lot more tests and  provide exception messages to assert keywords
(supported in GoodTests)
- Better error message when trying to set various attributes directly
- Add "setAttributes"  method that takes a dict and allows setting many
attributes at once
- Added nextSibling, nextSiblingElement, previousSibling, previousSiblingElement
- Added insertBefore and insertAfter (latter not present in HTML)

* 6.1.0 Aug 5 2015
- Fix issue where root node  would not get matched in some conditions
- Implement some real tests using GoodTests
- Much better handling of special attributes through a dedicated extension of
dict
- Ability to use "style" in the same way javascript allows, like
element.style.position = 'absolute'
- Various cleanups

* 6.1.0 prerelease July 27 2015
- More intuitive usage  with multiple root-level nodes (like parsing an AJAX
request). Add `getRootNodes` function to return a list of root nodes, and
abstracted a little magic of the previous handling of multiple root nodes.
They always worked before, but easier to work WITH now.
- Add "removeAttribute" function to remove an attribute
- Implement "setStyle" "setStyles" and "getStyle" - for working with the
"style" string. I will probably turn this into a real object extending str
before the release, but I'm tired now and going to bed.
